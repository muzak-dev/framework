All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows

**Changed** with the migration.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- API versioning. `AppOptions.Versioning` turns it on, `WithVersion` declares
  what a route or router answers, and the version is read from the path, a
  header, the `Accept` header or a function of your own. See
  [Versioning](https://muzak.dev/docs/fundamentals/versioning).
- Per-address bounds on long-lived connections: `WSOptions.MaxConnectionsPerIP`
  and `SSEOptions.MaxStreamsPerIP`, so one client cannot hold every slot the
  process has.

### Changed

- The module path is `muzak.dev/framework` and the package is `muzak`.
